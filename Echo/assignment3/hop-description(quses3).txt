As client (67.4.5.2) wants to resolve the domain "subdomain.webscienceexampledomain.com" using DNS, \\
Let us assume 67.4.5.2 is the ISP which process the DNS query for the client. \\
67.4.5.2 - Creates IP packet where, \\
Source - 67.4.5.2 \\
Destination: 26.155.36.7 (IP of the name server with which the sub-domain, client requested, is handled). \\ \\

1. Getting  IP address for the name server of  webscienceexampledomain.com: \\
For a DNS request, the IP packet will be sent to the root name server first. \\
Here, the IP for root name server is 25.8.2.1 \\
From 67.4.5.2, \\
1.1. Next hop: 67.68.3.1 in router 1 \\
1.2. Next hop (for any destination in 25.0.0.0 network from router 1): 88.6.32.1  in router 3 \\
1.3. Next hop (for any destination in 25.0.0.0 network from router 3): 25.03.1.2 in router 3 \\
1.4. From, 25.03.1.2 it can reach to any IP of 25.0.0.0 network, in our case 25.8.2.1 \\
As it is not the final destination, the client is looking for,
it will send another IP packet back to 67.4.5.2 with the information of IP address of the name server for 
the domain "webscienceexampledomain.com" which is 156.3.20.2 \\ \\

1.5. Nex hop: 25.03.1.2 in router 3\\
1.6. Next hop (for any destination in 67.0.0.0 network from router 3): 88.4.32.6 in router 1 \\
1.7. Next hop (for any destination in 67.0.0.0 network from router 1): 67.68.3.1 in router 1 \\
1.8. From, 67.68.3.1 it can reach to any IP of 67.0.0.0 network, in our case 67.4.5.2 \\ \\


2. Getting  IP address for the name server of  subdomain.webscienceexampledomain.com: \\
Now the source knows the IP address of the name server for the domain webscienceexampledomain.com. \\
So, a request will be sent to this IP address now (156.3.20.2). \\

2.1. Next hop: 67.68.3.1 in router 1 \\
2.2. Next hop (for any destination in 156.3.0.0 network from router 1): 88.6.32.1  in router 3 \\
2.3. Next hop (for any destination in 156.3.0.0 network from router 3): 205.30.7.1  in router 2 \\
2.4. Next hop (for any destination in 156.3.0.0 network from router 2): 156.3.0.6  in router 2 \\
2.5. From, 156.3.0.6 it can reach to any IP of 156.3.0.0 network, in our case 156.3.20.2 \\
As it is not the final destination, the client is looking for,
it will send another IP packet back to 67.4.5.2 with the information of IP address of the name server for 
the sub-domain "subdomain.webscienceexampledomain.com" which is 26.155.36.7 \\ \\

2.6. Next hop: 156.3.0.6 in router 2
2.7. Next hop (for any destination in 67.0.0.0 network from router 2): 141.71.20.1 in router 1 \\
2.8. Next hop (for any destination in 67.0.0.0 network from router 1): 67.68.3.1 in router 1 \\
2.9. From, 67.68.3.1 it can reach to any IP of 67.0.0.0 network, in our case 67.4.5.2 \\ \\
	

3. Sending request to the name server of  subdomain.webscienceexampledomain.com: \\
Now the client (67.4.5.2) has the IP address of the name server of subdomain.webscienceexampledomain.com \\
So, a request will be sent to this IP address now (26.155.36.7). \\

3.1. Next hop: 67.68.3.1 in router 1 \\
3.2. Next hop (for any destination in 26.0.0.0 network from router 1): 141.71.26.3  in router 2 \\
3.3. Next hop (for any destination in 26.0.0.0 network from router 2): 26.3.2.1  in router 2 \\
3.4. From, 26.3.2.1 it can reach to any IP of 156.3.0.0 network, in our case 26.155.36.7 \\

This is the IP Address associated to the requested subdomain.webscienceexampledomain.com \\
So, it will response back to the 67.4.5.2 (Client/ISP) with answer. \\

3.5. Next hop: 26.3.2.1 in router 2 \\
3.6. Next hop (for any destination in 67.0.0.0 network from router 2): 141.71.20.1 in router 1 \\
3.7. Next hop (for any destination in 67.0.0.0 network from router 1): 67.68.3.1 in router 1 \\
3.8. From, 67.68.3.1 it can reach to any IP of 67.0.0.0 network, in our case 67.4.5.2 \\ \\

As we assumed that our ISP is 67.4.5.2 - it will response back the answer to our client that is 67.4.5.2.
