TASK 2
---------------
1.Observations:
===============
1. In this dataset, each article has a specific topic
// 1. This dataset contains more articles about specific topics than other topics
2. This dataset contains more articles with positive affect than negative
3. This dataset does not contain any non-english words

--------------------------
2.Explain One observation:
==========================
1. In this dataset, each article has a specific topic
To find the most noted topic in the simple english wikipedia and therefore know the most interesting topic in some cases.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.Hypothesis FOR "In this dataset, each article has a specific topic"
=========================================================================================
1. Computer science related articles is 50% more common in the dataset than other topics.
In our case we have chosen to check the distribution of computer science related topics in the dataset, and that is justified by
counting the computer science terms occurances in each article.
otherwise, anyone can change the keywords text file to find other topics.
Falsible: Computer science related articles are less than 50% in the dataset
2. Computer science words occurances are more than 40% in most articles
Falsible: Computer science words occurances are less than 40% in the articles of the dataset
3. 

----------------------
4.Testable prediction:
======================
(a) The percentage of the computer science related articles will be high (higher than 50%)
(b) The percentage of the computer science terms in the dataset will be high
The percentage that we are predicting of computer science terms in the dataset is around %40, and we expect to see the diagram of (distribution of computer science articles in the dataset) as: (expectedgraph.png)

-------
5.Plan:
=======
1. We will find articles those contains keywords of computer science terms(computer.txt).
2. Collect in both different dictionaries. 1) the amount of computer science words in each article. 2) the amount of articles about computer science
3. First dictionary we will find the average of computer science words distributed in the dataset. Second dictionary we will find the average of computer science articles in the dataset
