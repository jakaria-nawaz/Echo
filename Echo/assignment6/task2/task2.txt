TASK 2
---------------
1.Observations:
===============
1. This dataset contains more articles about specific topics than other topics
2. This dataset contains more articles with positive affect than negative
3. This dataset does not contain any non-english words

--------------------------
2.Explain One observation:
==========================
1. This dataset contains more articles about specific topics than other topics
To find the most noted topic in the simple english wikipedia and therefore know the most interesting topic in some cases.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.Hypothesis FOR "This dataset contains more articles about Computer Science than others"
=========================================================================================
1. Computer science related articles is more common in the dataset than other topics. In our case we have chosen to check the distribution of computer science related topics in the dataset. otherwise, anyone can change the keywords text file to find other topics.
Falsible: Computer science related articles could be very less in the dataset
2. Computer science words are very common and distributed in most articles
Falsible: Computer science word are not very common in the articles of the dataset
3. 

----------------------
4.Testable prediction:
======================
(a) The percentage of the computer science terms in the dataset will be high
The percentage that we are predicting of computer science terms in the dataset is around 40%, and we expect to see the diagram of (distribution of computer science articles in the dataset) as: (expectedgraph.png)

-------
5.Plan:
=======
1. We will find articles those contains keywords of computer science terms(computer.txt).
2. Collect in both different dictionaries. 1) the amount of computer science words in each article. 2) the amount of articles about computer science
3. First dictionary we will find the average of computer science words distributed in the dataset. Second dictionary we will find the average of computer science articles in the dataset
