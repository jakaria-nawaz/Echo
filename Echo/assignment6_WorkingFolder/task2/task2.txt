TASK 2
---------------
1.Observations:
===============
After observing the first 10-20 articles in the dataset:
1. In this dataset, computer science terms occurances are so less.
2. In this dataset, each article has a specific topic
3. This dataset contains more articles with positive affect than negative
4. This dataset does not contain any non-english words

--------------------------
2.Explain One observation:
==========================
1. In this dataset, computer science terms occurances are so less.
To find the average percentage of computer science terms occurance in all articles in the dataset is interesting because then we know how frequent it is to have
computer science terms distributed in different kinds of article topics.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.Hypothesis FOR "In this dataset, each article has a specific topic"
=========================================================================================
1. Computer science related articles is 20% more common in the dataset than other topics.
Falsible: Computer science related articles are less than 20% in the dataset

2. Computer science words occurances are more than 40% in all articles in the dataset
Falsible: Computer science words occurances are less than 40% in all articles of the dataset

3. 

----------------------
4.Testable prediction:
======================
(a) The average percentage of the computer science terms in the dataset will be around (40%)
The percentage that we are predicting of computer science terms in the dataset is around %40. In our case we have chosen to check the distribution of computer 
science terms in the dataset, and that is justified by counting the computer science terms occurances in each article over the number of all words in the article.
Then sum all the percentages.

-------
5.Plan:
=======
1. We will find articles those contains keywords of computer science terms(computer.txt).
2. Collect in both different dictionaries. 1) the amount of computer science words in each article. 2) the amount of articles about computer science
3. First dictionary we will find the average of computer science words distributed in the dataset. Second dictionary we will find the average of computer science articles in the dataset
