Here we have to calculate 3 different ranking depending on what these 3 different models give 
result on a certain condition on a same set of data. \\
We can take different approach like calculate the text similarities or calculate based on intersections
among the rankings. But after little study what has been found is little more reliable and easier
approach for comparing the rankings, it is 'Set Based Measure - Rank Biased Overlap'. This measure is used to compare 
various rankings for the same object. \\
Here what we are going to do is, \\
1. Take a random article x. \\
2. Take a set (y(100)) of 100 article, some from before the index and some from after the index of x. \\
3. Compare each element from set y(100) with x. \\
4. Sort the Jaccard, Cosine similarity and the graph with Jaccard value and take
top 10 most similar articles for each similarty measure js(10), cs(10), jgs(10). \\
5. Implement 'Set Based Measure - Rank Biased Overlap' on these 3 different rankings. We will find if they are same or if different,
how different are they. We will also find which of the 2 rankings are more similar.\\
Here is a the reference links where I found about this 'Set Based Measure - Rank Biased Overlap': \\

After calculating this we will be able to answer the question asked in the task 1.3 (According to our choosen 
methodology - Set Based Measure - Rank Biased Overlap.). \\
