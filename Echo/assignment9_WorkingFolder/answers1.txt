Potential parts you could find in research paper abstracts:
1. The background and the problem that is tackled in the research
2. The used methodology in the research
3. One to three precise research question that are answered in the research paper
4. Giving the "Unique idea" or the solution
5. Pointing the results
6. A conclusion with a point of impact

The potential parts marked from the given abstract:
1. The background and the problem:
Hit songs, books, and movies are many times more successful than average, suggesting that “the best” alternatives are qualitatively different from ``the rest''; yet experts routinely fail to predict which products will succeed.
2. The used methodology:
We investigated this paradox experimentally, by creating an artificial ``music
market''
3. One precise research question:
14,341 participants downloaded previously unknown songs either with or without knowledge of previous participants’ choices.
4. Unique idea:
Increasing the strength of social influence increased both inequality and unpredictability of success.
5. Results:
The best songs rarely did poorly, and the worst rarely did well, but any other result was possible.
6. Point of impact:
Success was also only partly determined by quality
