Potential parts you could find in research paper abstracts: \\
\begin{enumerate}
\item The background and the problem that is tackled in the research
\item The used methodology in the research
\item One to three precise research question that are answered in the research paper
\item Giving the "Unique idea" or the solution
\item Pointing the results
\item A conclusion with a point of impact
\end{enumerate}

The potential parts marked from the given abstract: \\
\begin{enumerate}
\item The background and the problem: \\
Hit songs, books, and movies are many times more successful than average, suggesting that “the best” alternatives are qualitatively different from ``the rest''; yet experts routinely fail to predict which products will succeed. \\
\item The used methodology: \\
We investigated this paradox experimentally, by creating an artificial - music market \\
\item One precise research question: \\
14,341 participants downloaded previously unknown songs either with or without knowledge of previous participants’ choices. \\
\item Unique idea: \\
Increasing the strength of social influence increased both inequality and unpredictability of success. \\
\item Results: \\
The best songs rarely did poorly, and the worst rarely did well, but any other result was possible. \\
\item Point of impact: \\
Success was also only partly determined by quality \\
\end{enumerate}
