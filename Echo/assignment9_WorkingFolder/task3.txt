1. Probability for sharing meme will increase if the meme topic is related to profession/culture of the 
agent. 
- Determining the subjects of all memes do not have a proper methodology because not all of them has a
#hashtag. Even if we consider only #hastag memes, it will not be possible to relate each meme with
the profession or culture of the meme. Even determining agent's culture/profession will not always be 100% correct.

2. An agent will share a meme of own political interest which is intentionly triggered by political/media
entity.
- This type of meme will have #hashtag as it is intentional. But determining agent's political interest is difficult.
So there are some more variables to consider which are not included in the model or the part of the system.

3. Probability of sharing meme of recent phenomena will be higher than older ones.
- It conflicts with reality because defination of 'recent phenomena' and collection of data of recent phenomena is
not defined. Considering the meme is given #hastag.

4. An agent's real time personal incident will have some influence on the agent to share specific memes.
- System can not track agent's real time personal incident in reality. So we can't model this real time incident.

5. Probability of sharing meme's which is related to the agent is higher than any random meme.
- 'Related to the agent' can mean many things. Also, if there is not #hastag in the meme it is not possible to be sure
about the topic of the meme.
